### How can you use dynamic polymorphism in Java to achieve the following tasks?

1. Create a base class `Animal` with a method `speak()` that displays a message for an invalid option.
2. Create two subclasses, `Dog` and `Cat`, that override the `speak()` method to display the sounds specific to each animal.
3. Implement a `Main` class that:
   - Prompts the user to select their favorite animal (either Dog or Cat) using `JOptionPane`.
   - Instantiates the appropriate subclass based on the user's choice and calls the `speak()` method to display the corresponding animal sound.
   - Defaults to the base class `Animal` if an invalid option is selected.
