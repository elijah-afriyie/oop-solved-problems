You are tasked with creating a Java program that models different types of vehicles. The program should use object-oriented programming principles to ensure it is well-structured, flexible, and reusable.

**Instructions:**

1. **Create a Base Class for Vehicles:**

   - This class should include common properties that all vehicles share, such as the vehicle's model and the year it was made.
   - Include methods that would be common to all vehicles, and consider how to represent different types of vehicles that have unique behaviors.

2. **Subclass Implementation:**

   - Think about different types of vehicles (e.g., aircraft, ships, cars) and how they might differ from each other.
   - Each subclass should have additional properties or methods specific to that type of vehicle.
   - Ensure each subclass can provide specific details about itself, such as its mode of transportation.

3. **Object Creation and Testing:**

   - Create a separate class where you will instantiate objects of your vehicle subclasses.
   - Test the behaviors and properties of each type of vehicle, ensuring they correctly display their information and unique behaviors.

4. **Enhance Functionality:**
   - After initial implementation, think about how you could extend or modify the base class to automatically include more specific details about each vehicle type when displaying information.

**Objectives:**

- Demonstrate your understanding of abstract classes and inheritance.
- Show how to use method overriding to provide specific implementations in subclasses.
- Utilize polymorphism to interact with different types of vehicle objects through a common interface.
- Test and validate the implementation, ensuring all features work as expected.

By completing this task, you should be able to show a thorough understanding of object-oriented programming concepts and how they can be applied to solve a practical problem.
